<<>>"Animal Farm" is the third book I have read in full English. The first was "The Little Prince," and the second was "The Old Man and the Sea." I bought these books about six years ago while I was in college. I remember it being slow and painful reading "The Little Prince" and "The Old Man and the Sea" because my English level was not good at that time.

<<>>After years of learning English, I found that when reading "Animal Farm" this time, my reading speed was faster than before. This progress gives me confidence in my English learning.

<<>>Regarding the book itself, "Animal Farm" is similar to "1984" but more explicit. Can a republic really exist?
